Your code has **multiple logical mistakes**, so the linked list will **NOT reverse**.
Let me show the mistakes and then give the correct fixed version.

# ❌ **Mistakes in Your Code**

### **1️⃣ Wrong stopping condition**

You wrote:

```java
while (current.next != null)
```

This stops before reaching the last node.
Correct: `while (current != null)`

---

### **2️⃣ You are not reversing any link**

This line does nothing:

```java
current.next = temp;
```

It assigns the same value back.

---

### **3️⃣ You overwrite `prev` incorrectly**

You wrote:

```java
prev = current.next;
```

But `prev` should point to the **already reversed list**, not the next node.

---

### **4️⃣ You move current incorrectly**

```java
current = current.next;
```

This follows old links, not reversed ones.

# ⭐ Correct Iterative Logic (3 Pointers)

Every step must do:

1. Save next node:

   ```java
   ListNode next = current.next;
   ```
2. Reverse link:

   ```java
   current.next = prev;
   ```
3. Move prev:

   ```java
   prev = current;
   ```
4. Move current:

   ```java
   current = next;
   ```

# ✅ **Correct Working Code (Fix Applied)**

```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode reverseList(ListNode head) {
        ListNode prev = null;
        ListNode current = head;

        while (current != null) {
            ListNode next = current.next; // Step 1: save next
            current.next = prev;          // Step 2: reverse link
            prev = current;               // Step 3: move prev
            current = next;               // Step 4: move current
        }

        return prev; // new head
    }
}
```

# 🧠 Dry Run Example

Original:

```
1 → 2 → 3 → null
```

Step 1:

```
1 → null
prev = 1
current = 2
```

Step 2:

```
2 → 1 → null
prev = 2
current = 3
```

Step 3:

```
3 → 2 → 1 → null
prev = 3
current = null
```

Return `prev` → final head = 3.

If you want, I can also explain:

✔ recursive version
✔ reverse first k nodes
✔ reverse between left and right (LC 92)

Just tell me!
