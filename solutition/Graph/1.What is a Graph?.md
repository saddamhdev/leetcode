Here is the **quickest, cleanest introduction to Graphs** — with visuals and simple breakdowns.

---

# **📌 What is a Graph?**

A **graph** is a collection of:

* **Nodes** (also called *vertices*)
* **Edges** (connections between nodes)

---

# **📌 Types of Graphs**

## **1. Undirected Graph**

Edges have **no direction**.

* Relationship is two-way
  Example: Facebook friends.

```
A —— B
```

## **2. Directed Graph (Digraph)**

Edges have arrows → direction.

Example: Instagram follow.

```
A → B
```

---

# **📌 Weighted Graph**

Each edge has a **cost/weight**.

Example: distance between cities.

```
A —5— B —3— C
```

---

# **📌 Cyclic vs Acyclic**

## **Cyclic Graph**

Contains at least one **cycle/loop**.

## **Acyclic Graph**

**No** cycles.

A very special acyclic directed graph = **DAG**.

---

# **📌 Representation of Graphs**

## **1. Adjacency Matrix**

2D matrix.

* Good for dense graphs
* Space = O(N²)

```
    A B C
A [ 0 1 0 ]
B [ 1 0 1 ]
C [ 0 1 0 ]
```

## **2. Adjacency List**

Most common.

* Good for sparse graphs
* Space = O(V + E)

```
A → [B]
B → [A, C]
C → [B]
```

# **📌 Graph Traversal**

## **1. BFS (Breadth-First Search)**

Level-order, uses **queue**.
Used for shortest path in unweighted graph.

## **2. DFS (Depth-First Search)**

Go deep, uses **stack/recursion**.

# **📌 Common Graph Algorithms**

| Algorithm            | Purpose                             |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **BFS**              | shortest path (unweighted)          |
| **DFS**              | cycle detection, components         |
| **Dijkstra**         | shortest path (weighted)            |
| **Bellman–Ford**     | shortest path with negative weights |
| **Floyd–Warshall**   | all-pairs shortest path             |
| **Kruskal / Prim**   | Minimum Spanning Tree               |
| **Topological Sort** | DAG ordering                        |
