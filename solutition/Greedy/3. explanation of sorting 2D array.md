No problem 👍
This line is **confusing for almost everyone at first**.
Let’s break it **VERY slowly**, with numbers and plain logic.

## 🔴 The Exact Line You Don’t Understand

```java
Arrays.sort(res, (a, b) ->
    (b[0] - b[1]) - (a[0] - a[1])
);
```

---

## 🧠 First: What are `a` and `b`?

When sorting a 2D array:

```java
res[i] = {technique1, technique2}
```

During sorting:

* `a` = one task → `{a[0], a[1]}`
* `b` = another task → `{b[0], b[1]}`

Example:

```text
a = {10, 8}
b = {5, 10}
```

---

## 🧮 Second: What is `(x[0] - x[1])`?

This means:

```text
technique1 points − technique2 points
```

### Why do we calculate this?

It tells us **how beneficial technique1 is** for that task.

| Value    | Meaning              |
| -------- | -------------------- |
| Positive | technique1 is better |
| Zero     | both same            |
| Negative | technique2 is better |

---

## 🔍 Third: Evaluate Each Part Separately

### Part 1

```java
b[0] - b[1]
```

“How much better is technique1 for task **b**?”

### Part 2

```java
a[0] - a[1]
```

“How much better is technique1 for task **a**?”

---

## 🔄 Fourth: Why subtract them?

```java
(b[0] - b[1]) - (a[0] - a[1])
```

This tells Java **which task should come first**.

### Comparator Rule (IMPORTANT)

| Result   | Meaning              |
| -------- | -------------------- |
| Positive | `b` comes before `a` |
| Negative | `a` comes before `b` |
| Zero     | order doesn’t matter |

---

## 🔥 Example (REAL Numbers)

### Suppose:

```java
a = {10, 8}   // diff = 2
b = {5, 10}   // diff = -5
```

Now calculate:

```java
(b[0] - b[1]) - (a[0] - a[1])
= (-5) - (2)
= -7
```

🔹 Result is **negative**
➡️ `a` comes **before** `b`

✔ That makes sense because:

* `a` benefits more from technique1

---

## 🟢 Another Example

```java
a = {2, 3}   // diff = -1
b = {10, 8}  // diff = +2
```

```java
(2) - (-1) = 3
```

🔹 Positive
➡️ `b` comes before `a`

✔ Again correct!

---

## 🧠 Final Meaning in One Sentence

> **Sort tasks so that the ones where technique1 is MOST useful come FIRST**

---

## ✨ Easier Way to Read (Same Logic)

If this line feels scary, read it like this:

```java
Arrays.sort(res, (a, b) -> {
    int diffA = a[0] - a[1];
    int diffB = b[0] - b[1];
    return diffB - diffA;
});
```

👉 SAME RESULT, much clearer.

---

## 🧪 Visual Summary

Before sorting:

```
{5,10} → diff = -5
{2,3}  → diff = -1
{10,8} → diff = +2
```

After sorting:

```
{10,8}
{2,3}
{5,10}
```

## 🏁 One-Line Memory Trick

> **“Sort by (technique1 − technique2) in descending order.”**

If you want, I can:

* Explain comparator using **if-else**
* Draw a **step-by-step comparison**
* Explain in **Bangla**
* Rewrite without lambda

Just tell me 👍
