Totally okay 👍
Let’s **forget algorithms** for a moment and understand **the problem itself**, very slowly, with **real-life style thinking**.
No greedy, no heap yet.

# 🧩 Problem (3767) — Plain English

You have **n tasks**.

For **each task**, you must choose **ONE** of two techniques:

| Choice      | Points you get  |
| ----------- | --------------- |
| Technique 1 | `technique1[i]` |
| Technique 2 | `technique2[i]` |

⚠️ **Rule**
You must use **Technique-1 at least `k` times**.
(Does NOT have to be the first k tasks.)

Your goal:

> **Get the maximum total points**

---

# 🧠 Think Like This (Very Important)

Each task is **independent**.
Your choice for task-0 **does not affect** task-1.

So for **each task**, ask:

> “Which technique gives me more points?”

But… there is a **restriction**:

> You cannot choose technique-2 for *all* tasks if `k > 0`.

---

# 🔍 Let’s Go Example by Example (Very Slowly)

---

## ✅ Example 1

```
technique1 = [5, 2, 10]
technique2 = [10, 3, 8]
k = 2
```

### Step 1: Compare per task

| Task | T1 | T2 | Better |
| ---- | -- | -- | ------ |
| 0    | 5  | 10 | T2     |
| 1    | 2  | 3  | T2     |
| 2    | 10 | 8  | T1     |

If **no rule**, best choice:

```
T2, T2, T1 → 10 + 3 + 10 = 23
```

But ❌ rule says:

> You MUST use technique-1 **at least 2 times**

Currently using T1 only **once** → ❌ not allowed

---

### Step 2: Which tasks should be forced to T1?

Switching a task from T2 → T1 **costs or gains**:

| Task | Switch Cost |
| ---- | ----------- |
| 0    | 5 - 10 = -5 |
| 1    | 2 - 3 = -1  |
| 2    | 10 - 8 = +2 |

👉 Meaning:

* Task-2 gives **+2 profit** if forced to T1
* Task-1 loses only **1 point**
* Task-0 loses **5 points** (worst)

---

### Step 3: Choose the **least harmful** tasks

We need **2 tasks with T1**.

Best choices:

* Task-2 (+2)
* Task-1 (-1)

Final selection:

```
Task 0 → T2 = 10
Task 1 → T1 = 2
Task 2 → T1 = 10
```

Total:

```
10 + 2 + 10 = 22 ✅
```

---

## ✅ Example 2

```
technique1 = [10,20,30]
technique2 = [5,15,25]
k = 2
```

Here **T1 is better everywhere**.

So just use T1 for all:

```
10 + 20 + 30 = 60
```

---

## ✅ Example 3

```
technique1 = [1,2,3]
technique2 = [4,5,6]
k = 0
```

No restriction → choose best always:

```
4 + 5 + 6 = 15
```

---

# 🧠 One Sentence Summary (Very Important)

> Choose the best technique per task, **but** if you don’t have enough Technique-1 tasks, **force it on the tasks where it hurts the least**.

That’s all the problem is asking.

# 🚫 What the problem is NOT

❌ Not order based
❌ Not consecutive
❌ Not stock buying
❌ Not DP
❌ Not Kadane

Just **choices + minimum count constraint**

If you want, next I can:

* Draw this as a **picture/diagram**
* Explain why this becomes **Greedy + Heap**
* Solve another custom example **you choose**
* Write pseudocode without Java

Just tell me 😊
