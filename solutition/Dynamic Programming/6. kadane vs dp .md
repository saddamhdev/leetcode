Great question 👍
This confusion is **very common**, even among experienced devs.
Let’s settle **Kadane vs DP** clearly, once and for all.

# 🧠 Kadane vs DP — The REAL Difference

> **Kadane is NOT different from DP**
> 👉 **Kadane is a SPECIALIZED, OPTIMIZED form of DP**

---

## 1️⃣ What is Dynamic Programming (DP)?

**Definition (interview-safe):**

> DP solves problems by breaking them into overlapping subproblems and storing their optimal results.

### Core DP properties

| Property                | Meaning                                  |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Overlapping subproblems | Same state reused                        |
| Optimal substructure    | Optimal solution built from smaller ones |
| State transition        | Formula to move between states           |

---

## 2️⃣ Kadane’s Algorithm (What exactly?)

Kadane is **DP with exactly 1 state**.

### Problem it solves

> Maximum subarray sum (contiguous)

### DP formulation

```
dp[i] = max subarray sum ending at index i
```

### Transition

```
dp[i] = max(nums[i], dp[i-1] + nums[i])
```

### Optimization

Instead of an array → **just one variable**

```java
curr = Math.max(nums[i], curr + nums[i]);
ans  = Math.max(ans, curr);
```

👉 That’s **Kadane**

## 3️⃣ Key Difference Table (Very Important)

| Aspect      | Kadane            | General DP                  |
| ----------- | ----------------- | --------------------------- |
| Is it DP?   | ✅ Yes             | ✅ Yes                       |
| States      | 1                 | Multiple                    |
| Memory      | O(1)              | O(n) or more                |
| Window type | Contiguous        | Contiguous / non-contiguous |
| Decision    | Extend or restart | Many transitions            |
| Complexity  | O(n)              | O(n), O(nk), O(2ⁿ)…         |

## 4️⃣ When Kadane Applies (Recognize instantly)

Kadane works **ONLY IF ALL are true**:

✔ Contiguous subarray
✔ Additive contribution
✔ Local decision (extend vs restart)
✔ Single dimension optimization

### Classic Kadane Problems

* Maximum subarray sum
* Maximum subarray product (variant)
* Maximum sum circular subarray
* “Flip at most one segment” problems

---

## 5️⃣ When Kadane FAILS ❌ (Needs full DP)

Kadane **cannot handle**:

| Scenario                             | Why                   |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------- |
| Multiple transactions                | Need multiple states  |
| Buy/Sell with limits                 | Need state tracking   |
| Gaps allowed                         | Not contiguous        |
| Constraints (k ops)                  | Needs extra dimension |
| Strategy modification (your problem) | Window constraint     |

## 6️⃣ Stock Problems: Perfect Comparison 📈

### 🔹 Simple Stock (1 transaction)

Kadane-like:

```text
profit = max(prices[j] - prices[i])
```

### 🔹 Stock with k transactions

Full DP:

```text
dp[t][i][state]
```

### 🔹 Your problem (3652)

✔ Fixed-length window
✔ Forced transformation
❌ Not extend/restart

➡ **Sliding window + prefix sums**, NOT Kadane

## 7️⃣ Mental Shortcut (Interview Gold 🥇)

Ask yourself:

> “At each index, can I decide **only using previous index**?”

| Answer       | Use            |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| YES          | Kadane         |
| NO           | DP             |
| Window fixed | Sliding Window |
| Range sum    | Prefix Sum     |

## 8️⃣ One-Liner You Can Say in Interview

> “Kadane’s algorithm is a space-optimized dynamic programming approach for maximum subarray problems with a single state and local transition.”

| Problem Type                | Tool           |
| --------------------------- | -------------- |
| Max subarray sum            | Kadane         |
| Max subarray with k changes | DP             |
